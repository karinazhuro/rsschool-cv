## About myself:

Hello, my name is Karina.\
I can be called a responsible and attentive person. I respect other people's opinions, I make compromises, but at the
same time I know how to defend my point of view. I treat my work with maximum efficiency.

When I was studying as an environmental engineer, I already had a desire to change my field of activity and develop in a
different direction, I realized that my interests were completely different and began to study programming. Programming,
and more specifically front-end development, I have been studying for more than 3 years. All the knowledge that I have I
got myself.

I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient
Frontend Developer.
