## About myself:

Hello, my name is Karina.\
I am starting my career like a Front-end developer.

I can be called a responsible and attentive person. I respect other people's opinions, I make compromises, but at the
same time I know how to defend my point of view. I treat my work with maximum efficiency.

## Skills:

* HTML/SCSS, БЭМ
* semantics, validity
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* React
* Git
* Gulp, Webpack, Babel

## Example code:

**Count characters in your string:** *The main idea is to count all the occurring characters in a string. If you have a
string like aba, then the result should be {'a': 2, 'b': 1}. What if the string is empty? Then the result should be
empty object literal, {}.*

```
function count(string) {
    const result = {};
    
    string.split('').map((el) => {
        const counter = result[el];
        
        if (!counter) result[el] = 1;
        else result[el] = counter + 1;
    });
        
    return result;
}
```
